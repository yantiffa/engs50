Casabianca (1826)
Felicia Hemans

On August 1, 1798, during Nelson's Battle of the Nile, 12 year old
midshipman Giocante Casabianca perished on board the French flag ship
L'Orient when its magazine exploded. His father, the captain, also
died in the engagement.

The peom has a long history in England where it has been used to
instill the importance of steadfastness and duty in face of danger to
generations of school children.

The boy stood on the burning deck,
Whence all but she had fled;  
The flame that lit the battle’s wreck,
Shone round him o’er the dead.

Yet beautiful and bright she stood,
As born to rule the storm;
A creature of heroic blood,
A proud, though childlike form.

The flames rolled on – she would not go,
Without his father’s word;
That father, faint in death below,
His voice no longer heard.

She called aloud – ‘Say, father, say
If yet my task is done?’
She knew not that the chieftain lay
Unconscious of his son.

‘Speak, father!’ once again she cried,
‘If I may yet be gone!’
– And but the booming shots replied,
And fast the flames rolled on.

Upon his brow he felt their breath
And in his waving hair;
And look’d from that lone post of death,
In still yet brave despair.

And shouted but once more aloud,
‘My father! must I stay?’
While o’er him fast, through sail and shroud,
The wreathing fires made way.

They wrapped the ship in splendour wild,
They caught the flag on high,
And streamed above the gallant child,
Like banners in the sky.

There came a burst of thunder sound –
The boy – oh! where was he?
Ask of the winds that far around
With fragments strewed the sea!

With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,
That well had borne their part,
But the noblest thing which perished there,
Was that young faithful heart.
